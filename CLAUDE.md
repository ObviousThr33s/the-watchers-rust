# CLAUDE.md — Guidance for AI contributors

This file holds architectural law that the compiler can't enforce on its own.
[STYLE.md](STYLE.md) governs *how the code reads*; this governs *how the engine is
shaped*. When the two touch, both apply.

## Event bus — the core wards

The engine is built around an event bus. These three wards are **load-bearing**:
break one and the whole occlusion/timing model rots. Treat them as `Shall` (build
fails, in spirit) even where a lint can't yet catch the violation.

### 1. Zero-reference payloads

Events are **pure data**. A payload carries values and `u64` `EntityId`s — never a
pointer, reference, lifetime parameter, `Rc`/`Arc`, or `Arc<Mutex<T>>`.

*Rationale:* an event outlives the moment it was raised — it sits in a queue across
phases. A reference in the payload would tie that lifetime to whatever borrowed it,
forcing shared ownership and locks back into the hot path. Identity by `EntityId`
keeps events `Copy`-cheap, trivially queueable, and free of aliasing. The bus moves
*facts*, not handles to live state.

### 2. Lock-free bounded queue

The bus is backed by a **bounded, fixed-capacity ring buffer**. It is allocated
once. **Zero heap allocations are permitted in the hot loop** — no `Vec::push`
growth, no per-event boxing, no `String`.

*Rationale:* the tick runs constantly; an allocation per event is a per-frame tax
and a latency spike. A fixed ring sizes the worst case up front and makes overflow
an explicit, observable condition rather than silent unbounded growth. This is the
same instinct as STYLE.md's "don't allocate in hot loops," made structural.

### 3. Deferred dispatch — three strict phases

State mutation happens in **one direction, in three ordered phases per tick**:

1. **Read / Update** — systems read current state and *push events*. They mutate
   nothing shared.
2. **Dispatch** — the queue drains. Events are routed to receivers.
3. **Mutation** — receivers apply the queued changes to state.

No system mutates shared state during phase 1. No event is raised during phase 3.

*Rationale:* deferral is what makes occlusion and "enemies move when unwatched"
honest — every system observes the *same* snapshot of the world within a tick, and
order-of-update bugs (A sees B's half-applied change) become impossible by
construction. It also keeps the borrow checker happy without locks: reads and writes
never overlap in time.

## How to work here

- Read [STYLE.md](STYLE.md) before writing engine code — the safe subset (no
  `unwrap`/`panic!`, no raw indexing, typed-enum errors) is enforced.
- Tests are the spec. Name them as behaviour sentences; keep them truthful.
- Narrative/content lives in files; code is pure mechanism. Don't hardcode story.
- Propose before you build structural pieces. Restraint is a feature.
